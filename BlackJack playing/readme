BlackJack2.1.3

Test 7/14/2025
Notes and issues

1.
Dealer Having BlackJack doesnt end hand 
I had "Q" , "2"
vs A

2.
Should ask for insurance check for blackJack then end hand if it has blackjack
insurance bet not actually changing bankroll

3.
Program allowed me to split "10", and a "Q"
not sure what rules are actually on that

4.
Surrender Crash game lol

5.
Blackjack not working fully 
is paying out 1.5 
giving options to stand, hit, ....
not sure it'll pay out if dealer hits 21 it should unless dealer has blackjack

6.
Dealer not checking for blackjack
