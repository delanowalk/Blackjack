Every thing is a mess in the orginizaional sense 
but working on it 

BlackJack2.1.1 - 2.1.3
Game play no basic stragerty 

2.1.3 testing 7/14/2025

1.
Dealer Having BlackJack doesnt end hand 
I had "Q" , "2"
vs A

2.
Should ask for insurance check for blackJack then end hand if it has blackjack
insurance bet not actually changing bankroll

3.
Program allowed me to split "10", and a "Q"
not sure what rules are actually on that

4.
Surrender Crash game lol

5.
Blackjack not working fully 
is paying out 1.5 
giving options to stand, hit, ....
not sure it'll pay out if dealer hits 21 it should unless dealer has blackjack

6.
Dealer not checking for blackjack
